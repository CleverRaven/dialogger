Dialogger
=========

[![Dialogger](http://i.imgur.com/ojQbysnl.png)](http://i.imgur.com/ojQbysn.png)

Dialogger is a simple dialogue graph editor. It saves your dialogue graph in
two file formats:

- **.dl** - JSON file including all visual layout information
- **.dlz** - optimized JSON, easier and faster to parse

It uses [NW.js](http://nwjs.io/) and [JointJS](http://www.jointjs.com/).

Running
-------

Binaries are provided, but if you want to hack on the project, first download

```shell
cd /path/to/app
/path/to/nwjs/nw .
```

See the [NW.js docs](http://docs.nwjs.io/) for more info.
